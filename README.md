# Trayport Technical Challenge - Software Developer

This respository contains a solution for the technical challenge for the role 
of Software Developer at Trayport Vienna.

## The problem – Find the bug

Your program shall search a text file for bugs and print the number of their 
occurrence. The bug is drawn ASCII – style and can be found within bug.txt.

For testing purposes, we provide a text file called landscape.txt. The contents
of this file is a lot simpler than the file that we will be testing the 
completed program. Each occurrence of the character pattern as specified in 
bug.txt is counted, except for the whitespaces contained therein.
